The Learner Driver application for iPhone is a 'proof of concept' project for Australia's Driver Licensing Department.
Its core features enable young Australian 'L' plated drivers to log their driving hours in a virtual logbook as a requirement to obtain their 'P' plates.
The app uses location services to track a learner driver's trip, tally up their hours and provide weather and traffic information via public API's.
Built for use by both the learner driver and their supervisor, the app also includes a sign on glass feature to capture supervisor signatures as proof of journey's logged.
